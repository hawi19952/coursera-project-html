    <p>I was born and raised until I became 14-years-old in Dammam and its nearby cities. I loved the beach, mainly Ras Tanoura Beach and other attractions. <br> Dammam was the place where I met most of my childhood friends and I still love till today</p>

    <p>Riyadh is where I got my first full-time job, my internship and my following work opportunities after graduation. <br> Riyadh is the capital city of Saudi Arabia, a vibrant sleepless place where I met so many inspiring people and I learned the start-up ecosystem in the region. <br> I still work there until now and I plan to extend my relationship with it further in the upcoming years.</p>

    <p>This place where my family is rooted to. We are called "Hassawi" in the local accent to reflect our origin by the family roots. <br>This place is beautiful, aggrecutlrual and socialy warm. People from Al-ahsa are known to be kind and welcoming and I'm always proud of being rooted to this place. I had my sun in this place, and since then, this place became a very special place to live in with people.</p>
